## About Me

I love building software that solve clear problems and does one thing well

- I'm interested in CLI tooling, web scraping, systems thinking, context enginnering, automation, algorithms, data structures, fullstack and game development
- I love to read and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.
- I am curious about how ideas turn into great software, so I spend most of my time building, testing, and shipping
- I work mainly with Python, TypeScript, Next.js, PostgreSQL and Tailwind because they let me move fast and learn by doing
- I care about simple systems, readable code, and architectures that make sense instead of feeling clever
- I learn in public, improve through projects, and document progress as I go. Right now, I am focused on building a portfolio that shows consistency, growth, and the ability to ship.
- Outside been on the screen i love crafting tech innovations with carton
- I started coding apps, games using mobile IDEs like Acode, Pydroid 3, Termux on my mother's phone before moving to a full laptop setup.
- Feel free to reach out to me for discussions on programming, tech trends, or anything else!
